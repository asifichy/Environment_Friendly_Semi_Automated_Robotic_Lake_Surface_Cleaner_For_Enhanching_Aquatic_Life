# Environment_Friendly_Semi_Automated_Robotic_Lake_Surface_Cleaner_For_Enhanching_Aquatic_Life: A Bangladesh's Perspective
This is my (with the help of my group members) CSE 400 capstone project. Here we have built a prototype robot for cleaning floating waste from lake surfaces. This is also first time research in Bangladesh.

Inspiring group members are: 
1. Md. Asif Imtiyaj Chowhdury
2. Mridul Ranjan Karmakar
3. Shafika Sikandar
